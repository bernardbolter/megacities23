        <h2>
          <b>Megacities</b> presents a portrait of country though its
          topography.
          <br />
        </h2>
        <h2>
          From the vantage point of a satellite, we see the similarities of our
          cites and how we are all connected through streets, sidewalks, rivers,
          highways, and train tracks.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          But it is always the subtleties that make us unique, and by seeing our
          world connected from such a view, you can also see the differences
          within the similar.
        </h2>

        <h3>
          "The first exhibition of the Megacities was at the skateboarding
          focused, <b>Circylar gallery</b>, in Berlin. For this exhibition I
          added the Skate City image to the series, which combines satellite
          images of famous skate spots and skateparks from the US.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          Growing up as a skateboarder, the city was my playground and adding
          this element to the series, I feel gives a better insight into what
          it's all about, a celebration of the urban."
